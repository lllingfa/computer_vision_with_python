# computer_vision_with_python

i read the book named computer wision with python,and i write the code according to the instructions in the book and they all work.

it includes ten chapters

1.chap1:basic

2.chap2:local image descriptions

3.chap3:image to image mappings

4.chap4:camera models and augmented reality

5.chap5:multiple view geometry

6.chap6:clustering images

7.chap7:searching images

8.chap8:classifying image content

9.chap9:image segmentation

10.chap10:opencv

you need install some packages before you run the code,when you learn the computer vision by runing the code,it is absulutely helpful to make you have a deep understanding of the algorithm in vision and even though they are some basic methods to solve the problems ,it also do benifit to read the latest paper which describe the state of art methods.
